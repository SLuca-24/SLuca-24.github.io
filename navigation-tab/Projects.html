  <h1>Smart Contract for online donations</h1>
  <p id="frase-work1">The first project I developed for Start2Impact University is a smart contract designed to facilitate online donations through blockchain technology. This initiative aims to revolutionize online fundraising by leveraging blockchain to ensure transparency, security, and automation. The smart contract I created simplifies the fundraising process, making it reliable and user-friendly for all participants. Built on the Ethereum network, one of the most trusted and widely used blockchain platforms, this contract pioneers a new, innovative approach to online donations. </p>

  <h1>Analysis of Ethereum protocols</h1>
  <p id="frase-work2">The second project is an in-depth analysis of four major Ethereum protocols: Uniswap, dYdX, Aave, and CryptoKitties. This research aims to provide businesses with comprehensive information to help them decide which of these protocols to integrate. The study includes detailed insights and recommendations for each protocol, culminating in a proposal for adopting a specific platform, along with the rationale behind the choice.</p>
